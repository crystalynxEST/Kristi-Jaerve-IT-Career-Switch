# Company Directory

## Project Overview:

This project aims to complete a partially developed "Company Directory" system that was initiated eighteen months ago but got stalled when the original developer left the company. The primary objective is to pick up where it left off and ensure the system's functionality aligns with the signed-off design. The existing codebase contains crucial elements such as button attributes for opening modals, responsive classes, modal show events ("show.bs.modal"), form submission handling, and frequent database interactions.

###### Things to keep in mind:

* Add any missing functionality to meet the project's requirements.
* Ensure the system's responsiveness, following a mobile-first approach.
* Implement features that allow maintenance of all tables in the database while safeguarding data integrity and preventing record deletions with dependencies.
* Note that the model supports only one location per department.
* Ensure the system functions as a server-based solution accessible by multiple users concurrently.

### User Interface:

The user interface provides the following features:

* Search functionality for personnel, locations, or departments, depending on the currently viewed table.
* Support for multiple users accessing the webpage simultaneously.
* Capabilities to add, amend, delete and view data(view for personnel table only).
* Incorporate error messages and reminders to guide users when adding, editing or deleting data.


### Technologies Used

This project is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies:

#### Frontend:

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
* Utilizes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design.
* Integrates [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for iconography.
* Leverages jQuery for enhanced interactivity.

#### Backend:

* PHP for server-side scripting.
* JSON and Ajax for data exchange.
* MySQL database for data storage and retrieval.
